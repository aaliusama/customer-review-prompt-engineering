"Normally, I wouldn't bother to contribute my thoughts on a movie made back in '94, but I'm doing so for two reasons: 1.) It is my favorite movie of all time (and like everyone that uses this database, I've seen quite a few) 2.) I just watched it again last night (on DVD for the first time), which motivated me to go to IMDB and read the reviews.  I was aghast to read some of the negative comments that this movie inspired in many contributors. The following is more for the naysayers than anyone else.For those that championed the opinion that it glamorized drug use and violence: well, this is an age-old argument that's been pretty much exhausted.  Summed up in the question: ""does art reflect reality or does reality reflect art?"", I believe that it's a two-way street, and Pulp Fiction, evil intentions or no, rides right down the middle.  It's a glimpse of a world that I dare say is alien to most of us, so who are you to question it's authenticity in regards to its use of drugs, violence, language, and a lax attitude towards them all.For those that complained about the pointless dialog that did nothing to promote the plot: have you never heard of character development?  A lot of the things that have been dismissed as pointless and wasteful can be attributed to educating the audience of the character's thoughts and attitudes.  The ""pointless"" conversation between Jules and Vincent about cheeseburgers illustrates that not only is Vincent a traveler (and drug user), but that the two have a good working relationship, share similar interests, and genuinely like each other.The ""pointless"" dialog between Butch and Fabienne regarding potbellies is an insight to their relationship.  That exchange yes is silly and contributes nothing to the plot itself, but those are the kinds of pointless conversations that are often shared between a couple.  It's almost a milepost as to the seriousness of their relationship that they can enjoy such a trivial exchange.And plot?  Well, as it's been stated many times: its redemption, stupid. Not only for Jules, but for Butch as well.  Anyone who doesn't see that doesn't really deserve to have their opinions read let alone considered with any modicum of seriousness.Regarding the non-linear editing: is there a real problem with that?  Did it really confuse people all that much?  Were you still trying to mentally arrange the scene sequence ten minutes after the credits ran, or like most of the people I saw it with, figured out the jumps rather quickly and enjoyed the diversion?  Did Tarantino do it simply for the sake of doing it in an effort to be hip and cool?  I think not.  I do believe it was done in order to have the film end on a high note.  The alternative, if he had stuck to a linear formula, would have been Fabienne and Butch riding off on Zed's chopper, and that would have been a bit disappointing.Acting: what's not to like?  Have you seen any of Travolta's movies prior to this?  Utter trash.  With this one performance, he erased dozens of regurgitated, forgetful roles of leading men in mass-produced romantic comedies and dramas.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance was simply unparalleled.  Bruce Willis, who is normally unimpressive, blew me away with his performance.  The scene in the hotel room when he goes nuts after not being able to find his watch was just a joy to watch.  Seeing him seething mad at his mate's packing incompetence, and his fighting back that emotion and trying to reflect the blame back on himself...well, just the facial expressions were priceless.Direction?  Are you serious?  The needle-through-the-chest scene is perhaps the best directed sequence I've ever had the pleasure to watch.  You WERE in that living room with them.  You felt the frenzy, you could smell the sweat and the bong water, and you were just as on-edge as Vincent when you realized the potentially bad things that could result from the incident. That intensity could not have been duplicated by anyone of mediocre or non-existent directing talent.  The choreography was in a word, perfect.And as far as hype, is concerned, how could such a gem of cinematography not be hyped?  In my own defense, I saw this movie THE DAY it was released (and many times since), only days after first watching Reservoir Dogs. Basically, I knew little of Tarantino, but I knew that Dogs was among the best movies I'd seen in a long time.  Although I had seen and enjoyed Natural Born Killers and True Romance prior to PF, I was at the time unaware that their origins were with Tarantino.Pulp Fiction deserves all of the hype and all of the praise that it spawned. If you haven't seen it yet, what in God's name are you waiting for?  If you saw it and didn't like it, what in God's name is wrong with you?  What part of the formula for a good movie is missing in Pulp Fiction?Kudos to those who have praised it, and thank you Quentin for upping the ante of quality movie making.  My apologies for the length.",Pulp Fiction deserves all of the hype and all of the praise that it spawned.,Samuel L. Jackson's performance was simply unparalleled.
This film is simply pure Art. Something to just watch and indulge in. It's one of those art pieces that never get boring. Tarantino refuses to show any flaws in this film. Cinema at it's peak.,This film is simply pure Art.,This film is simply pure Art.
"There is not much that can be said about Pulp Fiction that hasn't been said countless times before, it is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and is never far away from the number one spot on many peoples lists. Acting – Spot on. Characters – Spot on.Script – Spot on. Storyline – almost non-existent but isn't that the point? Spot on. Soundtrack – Spot on. Editing – Spot on. Quentin Tarantino – Genius.Pulp Fiction is a complete joy to watch. John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson give the performances of their careers. Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames & 'The Wolf' all give great supporting performances also.Pulp Fiction is an utterly pointless film; it is a movie that relies heavily on its characters and their scripts. The storyline is basic and feels unfinished but that is the entire point! It is a movie about nothing, it's simply a snippet into the lives of the characters and the timeline is all over the place, jumping backwards and forwards throughout the film. It follows two hit-men, a gangster, an underground boxer, drug dealers & a man who is contracted to get people out of the stickiest of situations, with complete calm!As 'perfect' as it is, I do have a problem with it. It's a controversial problem no doubt, and that is Bruce Willis and his hour long scene in the centre of this movie. I wouldn't say I dislike Bruce Willis as such but I do find him somewhat irritating and when I watch Pulp Fiction I do skip his scenes. In my opinion he isn't relevant and I don't feel the film would have missed his presence if he wasn't involved. This however doesn't affect my feelings for the film as a whole as the scenes with Jackson & Travolta are faultless and some of my favourite scenes in cinema. I consider Pulp Fiction to be a masterpiece.10/10",I consider Pulp Fiction to be a masterpiece.,Quentin Tarantino – Genius.
"Well I had heard a lot about this movie earlier but after seeing it I can only say that it is a below average movie. I mean the only thing I enjoyed was some dialogs (although most of them were out of context)and nice editing job.But the story ,if there was one was plain boring .Acting was OK except Samuel who was great. I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke. Also Bruce Willis part was half baked and had very little significance for the story.So overall this movie which is a ""so called classic"" disappoints because bits of comedy like the Bonnie situation are not enough to make a movie classic.","I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke.","""I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke."""
"I'm not into writing reviews, but IMDb asked me to do it. And considering the fact that tomorrow I have an exam and I don't want to start preparing for it, I would better write this shitty words instead of studying. So, I've watched this movie for the goddamn unknown time and it's still entertaining as a freaking Disneyland for adults. And, by the way, I must admit that minimum size of 10 lines is a really brutal torture for me, as I'm suffering from a lack of imagination as hell. And the film is still amazing, yeah, don't forget that this text is supposed to be about Pulp Fiction. In conclusion, I'd like to shout out to my mom, my sister, my cat Partisan and my beautiful girlfriend. Their support really helped me to write this review and to overcome this terrible challenge. This looks like the end. I hope nobody will really read this.","And the film is still amazing, yeah, don't forget that this text is supposed to be about Pulp Fiction.","""And, by the way, I must admit that minimum size of 10 lines is a really brutal torture for me, as I'm suffering from a lack of imagination as hell."""
"This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB.",This was a BOMB.,This was a BOMB.

"I must average viewing this flick around six times per year. Every two months -- yeah, that sounds about right. Are there really any other films out there with legendary scene after legendary scene after legendary scene? Maybe, but not on the same scale as Pulp Fiction.Who hasn't seen this already?

"Every movie has at least one person who doesn't like it just as every great movie has at least 1 person who does not enjoy the film, this film not the exception that proves the rule but rather a text book example.  Warning: not everyone will love this movie.  That aside, the rest of you will hold this movie next to such timeless classics as The Godfather Part I and The Usual Suspects, this isn't a ""One-hit Wonder,"" Quentin Tarantino has proven himself perhaps as the best director of our time, second to Francis Ford Coppola, maybe.  No, Pulp Fiction is a movie that doesn't rely on special effects or hype to sell as does many movies such as Lord of The Rings. This movie is real.  The monolog delivered by John Travolta in Swordfish applies to this movie: no moronic sentences, no bad acting, and a story seemingly flawless.  Yes this movie deserves to be compared to The Godfather Part I, and buy the DVD.","Quentin Tarantino has proven himself perhaps as the best director of our time, second to Francis Ford Coppola, maybe.",Pulp Fiction is a movie that doesn't rely on special effects or hype to sell as does many movies such as Lord of The Rings.
"Pulp Fiction has been my all-time favorite film for a couple of years now and I have seen many films in the past but nothing can out beat the film. Everything about the film was magnificent. The script, by one of my favorite directors Quentin Tarantino, is the best writings I have ever seen. The performances were brilliant. All of them played their roles perfectly especially Samuel L. Jackson, who played Jules Winnfield. The direction, camera view, dialouge, and humour were all amazing in this one of the most popular films ever made. Overall, in my opinion nothing can out stand Pulp Fiction and its flawless scenes. It definitely set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history and that is why Pulp Fiction is the greatest film ever made.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+","Overall, in my opinion nothing can out stand Pulp Fiction and its flawless scenes.",Pulp Fiction is the greatest film ever made.
"Now, what can I say about ""Pulp Fiction""? You've all heard of it and may be wondering what all the hype is about. I won't delve into all the details in this review so the best I can do (without spoiling the movie) is to just explain some of the things that were great about it. A noticeable quality about ""Pulp Fiction"" that really struck me (and part of what made it so great)was the dialogue. The dialogue dwells on seemingly pointless subjects, such as what a quarter pounder with cheese is called in France, yet is so encapsulating. 80% of the film is dialogue and surprisingly, it is consistently kept interesting. Whereas in most movies, the dialogue seems to jump around and pass away as the story moves along, the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction"" sets itself up to be played out in future situations(You'll see what I mean) and in this way, Tarantino is able to create many instances of irony and maintain a solid story. In an interview Quentin Tarantino discussed the nonlinear script and explained that if writers can use this format in their books and have such freedom in their storytelling, why couldn't he? How right he is. Tarantino started nothing short of a revolution in the film world by doing so. With the 5 different mini-""stories"" in the film(Jules and Vincent, Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega, the Bonnie Situation, the Diner, and the Golden Watch) Tarantino unravels each of the characters' stories and shows the viewer what happens after and before what appear to be cliché situations. The result is something the likes of which you have never seen before. And not only that, Tarantino was able to intertwine all of the different stories and bring them together into a unified theme, ending with an iconic scene that will leave you speechless. At this point, I must address the complaints of many people who think that ""Pulp Fiction"" is merely a flick that revels in drug use, language, and violence. On the contrary, ""Pulp Fiction"" is essentially a moral story with a strong theme of redemption yet it is told through ""immoral"" characters(hit men, robbers, mob bosses, etc.). Think of all of the great literary pieces in history that were banned and condemned for their immorality but are praised for their genius today! Of course, there's nothing wrong with a good Disney movie for family fun and moral values, but Tarantino's style provides a breath of fresh air to the cinematic community. Not to mention all of the other motifs, plot devices, and iconic scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" is abundant with thrills, chills, and laughs. There is nothing more I can do except to say, get off your butt, go to blockbuster and rent it. ""You won't know the facts until you know the fiction"".",Tarantino started nothing short of a revolution in the film world by doing so.,Tarantino started nothing short of a revolution in the film world by doing so.
"Although it describes the life of people at the bottom of society, it does not make people feel as vulgar as its title. This film is very interesting in structure, narrative, theme, soundtrack, and performance. It is an unforgettable gangster movie.",It is an unforgettable gangster movie.,It is an unforgettable gangster movie.
"Quentin Tarantino is the used car salesman of Hollywood, and this film is just another previously-owned cheap ride. The glowing suitcase bit was stolen from the 1955 noir film Kiss Me Deadly. Samuel L. Jackson's bible-quoting hitman character was stolen from the 1973 Japanese martial arts film Karate Kiba. Tarantino takes four anecdotes and cuts them out of order to fool the viewer. Tarantino knows his story his boring, so he splatters blood around various sets, uses profanity to an extreme, and regresses to violence befitting of his character. His success is in knowing the vast majority of the public does not watch movies made before their own birthdate, so he can get away with cinematic larceny. At a Hollywood film panel, in 2006, a popular film critic called Tarantino a ""hack"" to which the audience applauded.","Tarantino knows his story his boring, so he splatters blood around various sets, uses profanity to an extreme, and regresses to violence befitting of his character.","At a Hollywood film panel, in 2006, a popular film critic called Tarantino a ""hack"" to which the audience applauded."
"It's the best movie I've ever seen.Pulp Fiction made my believe to the chance stronger.It really exists,I mean luck.The screenplay is wonderful,dialogs are interesting and the characters are understandable.Tarantino's made a miracle that will never be forgotten.Pulp Fiction's incredible dialogs and great acts and informal story,made me not to move until the end.Mr.Director and his movie changed my idea about all the movies I watched after that.There's a dialog throughout the movie from the Holy Bible:""And I will strike down upon thee with the great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.""It may be about me.At first I suspected him and I wanted to poison and destroy his brothers!But he really did it!He revenged me and after he got finished I really felt damned and crushed.I thought Pulp Fiction is not a good one to spend your time and watch it.But it actually cost. I'm sure it was one of the movies that its beginning was the end of it.Or in better language,it was one of the first postmodern movies.Take it easy. How can your luck be bad?This movie has lots of bad chances.Your boss's wife overdoses and is dying on you and this thing must be unknown.What will you do?You get out of the toilet and see your enemy is standing right at opposite of you and wants to kill you with your own gun.Or you're talking to your friend and he's sitting at the car's behind seat.You look at him during the talk and your pistol's in your hand,suddenly your gun takes the shot by itself.You haven't shot the legs,hands,or even the chest;You've shot straight at your friend's head!And when you wake up,you've taken s--t in the car and it's full of blood and skull pieces.What will you do to hide from the cops?There are many things like this.Well it's great.Enjoy the acts and screenplay.Some dialogs are so funny some are about bad things.Pulp Fiction is a real pulp fiction.PULP FICTION IS THE LORD.",PULP FICTION IS THE LORD.,PULP FICTION IS THE LORD.
"This is an absolutely amazing film. Great story. Great characters. The layout of the film is truly amazing and goes against the classical 3 stage story, almost as if it is 4 short films with multiple separate protagonists and antagonists. It breaks the norm of movie story telling and that's why it is so highly renowned in the movie industry. Definitely would recommend.",This is an absolutely amazing film.,This is an absolutely amazing film.
"A very good movie this is,but one sees overtime that Pulp Fiction may be the most overrated movie of all time. Tarantino makes movies for teenagers and in the process takes what he does from other great directors and packages it as his own. This may be a great movie but no, though Tarantino's film may have achieved greatness this not the 9th greatest film of all time. Good, Tarantino may be but as good as he is he is twice as much a narcissistic, arrogant, loquacious,bad man. What I mean is I wouldn't spend my time with Tarantino, not so much because I don't like him, but because I can't stand the smell of his fans and the rest of his crony balogni phonies.","This may be a great movie but no, though Tarantino's film may have achieved greatness this not the 9th greatest film of all time.",Pulp Fiction may be the most overrated movie of all time.

"Pulp Fiction (1994) **** (out of 4) Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the ""real"" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that ""Bad Motherf&*&er,"" which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age.","Pulp Fiction truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with.",PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age.
